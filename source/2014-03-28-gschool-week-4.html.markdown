It's sometimes difficult to reflect back on the last four weeks of gSchool without
recognizing that my life as a whole has done a complete backflip in that one short
month.<br>

I left my job at a college in Flint, MI just five days before starting gSchool.
Because of the abbreviated timeline, it took me almost two solid weeks to adjust to a
the newness of everything around me that had changed.<br>

Last night, after spending far too many hours writing and failing Capybara tests, I
looked over at my wife and said "every failing test I have is a solid confirmation that I'm
finally doing something I really enjoy." It was shocking to me that I could find such frustrating
pleasure in my plainly inadequate code.<br>

As a former video editor, I'm familiar with peeling away the layers of something and
building entirely new projects from those scraps. However, aside from an approving nod from
my boss, I rarely got a solid confirmation that I was doing things the right way. The land of
video editing is almost entirely based on tastes and flavors of style.<br>

While I'm completely aware of stylistic choices and coding preferences that exist in every
programmer, I'm choosing to focus this week on the simplicity of passing and failing tests.
Green makes me happy and red keeps me going.
