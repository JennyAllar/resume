As we round out week 5 of gSchool, I find the term "rollercoaster" (as used frequently in our retro this week) perfectly
sums up my experience thus far.

Currently, my rollercoaster defies most engineering rules and has small, meaningful ups paired with a vast amount of
dramatic and deep deep downs.

I've come to realize that as soon as I have a somewhat confident grasp on a piece of material, something like an SQL or
migration knocks me right on my ass and takes residence over my fears for hours or days.

While looking for google image to use as an appropriate visual representation of said emotional rollercoaster, I found
myself failing miserably- again - at just one more thing. I couldn't even make a funny enough rendition of to what I was
referring.

So, in an attempt to stop focusing so much on my failures, I'm instead going to put more energy into the successes I've
found within myself. When the going gets tough, I'm planning to revisit some of the baby steps used in earlier weeks.
Solidifying that we've come a long way and although the road ahead is long, it's a wonderful to revisit the feeling of
confidence.
