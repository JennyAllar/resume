Finishing up the sixth week of gSchool sort of felt like celebrating my 25th birthday. I'm feeling somewhat accomplished
while fearing a lack of appropriate progress. Being that the end of the sixth week marked the first quarter of class
gone, I've contemplated whether or not I feel that I'm 1/4 of the way to being an actual junior developer.

Self assessment aside, our gSchool instructors handed us a gift at the beginning of the week. They announced that we'd
be covering no new material and that we could use the week to really focus on some individually troubling concepts.
Having this week to look at my skills and see what was lacking the most was like finding an open window in a burning
building.

I spent most of the week working through databases, migrations, and some other basics used in the weeks prior. I also
prepared for my first ever lightning talk. It was a terrifiying experience because I'm typically not comfortable
speaking in public. However, once the lightning talk was finished, it was nice to add one more accomplishment to my
ever growing tool bag of developer skills. I now know that public speaking is a skill that might one day set one
developer apart from another. It's just one more thing I'd like to work on and polish as I become more comfortable with
my skillset.
