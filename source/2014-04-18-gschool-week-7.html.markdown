Week seven of gSchool ended on such a high! We worked on a user authentication application in pairs over the course of
the week and finished up the project on Thursday. Immediately following the emphatic high fives amongst partners in
the room and tales of exciting successes, we joined a great group of people from the community in a gSchool sponsored
happy hour.

Being thrust into such a socially demanding scene can be somewhat intimidating. It seems we're constantly flexing our
various muscles found in our skill set. Just when we're becoming comfortable with Sinatra or getting the hang of Bcrypt,
we find ourselves in a situation that completely switches gears and we're forced to turn on our networking and the softer
side of our skills. I've found that transformation to be somewhat refreshing. It leaves me in a state of never feeling
too comfortable, which is what I had envisioned gSchool would demand.

It's extremely motivational to always feel like I'm on my toes. The last seven weeks have certainly set a precedence for
what is expected of us and what we should expect from the next 16 weeks. I think, in keeping us on our toes, we're
gaining an incredible skill, particularly for working in the world of technology. It's critical to never get too
comfortable with a specific piece of technology, language, or way of thinking because the world is constantly changing
around us and if we're not moving with it, it become further and further from our reach.

I knew gSchool would teach me a boatload of technical skills. My blog posts always seem to center on the softer side of
things because I had definitely not anticipated the non-technical and life skills we'd subtly be learning along the way.


gSchool is teaching us to not just code, but to be valuable and multi-faceted software developers.
